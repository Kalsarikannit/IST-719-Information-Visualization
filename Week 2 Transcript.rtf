\par .
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Good morning.  Hi, how are you?  Have you scoped the website before?  Do you know what scoping is?  You code to the HTML off the page.  Okay.  Um, so there is a project that I'm wo
rking on, the project is called R in social media.  We are collecting data from sites that are not Twitter.  So this is a whole different experience.  And this is what I'm going to have you work on with me.  Now, there are two tasks and one of them is qua
litatively analyzing the data and the other might be quantitatively analyzing the data.  You will probably be involved in both of those.  There is not a team meeting for this.
\par The reason is, there is a master student working on this your her name is sit [indiscernible] meet me.  We will meet in my office next week at the same time.
\par Are you in this class too?  Twice as much work?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible] are you guys ready?  I'm ready.  What's this class about?  Creating I candy \_\_ this class is really about
 data, it's about data.  So some of what we do in this class is actually figuring out how to work with data and clean up data and how to make it so that we can visualize it.
\par So today we are talking about data.  Doesn't that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 sound like fun?  Everybody nods, e}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 ven though most people are falling asleep.
\par We will talk about assignments for next week.  Here is next week.  Here is what is mostly due.  So there is reading to do.  If you took quiz one, then you know some of the quiz questions reflect stuff that is in the reading.  And then you will submit \_\_
 let's see, there are six chart exercises out of visualization list chapter four.  This information is on Blackboard.  I'm going to Blackboard in a minute and walk you through things.
\par I want you to do the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
 portions only.  The exertions chapter four Visual This, they have an Illustrator part, we will do that next week or the next week after.  And so by the time that you leave this class, you will actually be decedent with Adobe Illustrator.  And so we wil
l talk more about that then.
\par There is also two extra parts.  There is a second part of the homework assignment.  That's going to be based on questions, I'll have a download a data set \_\_ from lab today, you can rework that for the second part of the homewo
rk.  That will be clearer in a minute.
\par When}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695  you upload the files, upload a}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  script, always, and a PDF.  You will combine all of the images and the graphics into one PDF.  That }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 is}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
 our general process.
\par Did you all have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  installed on your own personal computer?  I recommend it, it's not required, but it's [indiscernible].  So that's nice.
\par So let's look at Blackboard.  [Pause].
\par Blackboard seems to be running very quickly this morning.  So this is what Blackboard looks like for you.  Righ
t?  Roughly?  Sometimes I send out announcements, if I forget to say something in class and I feel that you need to know or a lot of people ask the same questions, I'll send out an assignment or reminders.
\par Discussion, there is a small discussion section.  Look like I need to clean stuff out of there.  When we do advances visualization preparations, sometimes people want to see slides.  So you can upload slides here.
\par I'll probably add a section in for functions that we covered.  I'll list the functions that we cover in lab every week.  You can post questions there.  I don't always check this, but I will look at it.  So if you have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  questions, you can post them there.  If you are on here and you see }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  questions and you know the answer, I encourage you to answer the questions for other people.
\par There is a mini syllabus here.  You can download the syllabus from here.  And here is the weekly assignment.  Now we have week one and two, but soon I'll post more so you can see that.
\par And resources.  So this is a book in PDF form, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 cookbook}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 , it goes into [indiscernible] and has }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  examples.  Here is the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  color chart and here are data resources.  We will come back to that another time.  Online versions of the book and information about posting poster printing.
\par And then, finally, data and images we will use in this class.  We are not having a party.  But we will use the images in visualizations.  So that's why they are there.  They are there for future reference.
\par Today we will load data.  So you will want to \_\_ not at this moment, but the time at lab, right click on each file and save the link as and then put on your desktop.  So we will come back to that.
\par Any questions about how we are using Blackboard?  All of the quizzes are in there.  All of the homework assignments, all of the \_\_.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Good question.  So last week I assigned a quiz and that quiz was due for the start of this class.  It was available right at the end of last class.  Homework}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 s}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  are the same.  You always have one week to do a quiz or a homework.  There are one or two cases where it's longer, but generally you have a whole week.
\par This week a lab is going to be available soon and the quiz is available at the end of class.  The labs are due the day we assign them.  Good questions.  Any other questions?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yes, but I may not answer.  Because the quizzes are based on the books and the lectures and stuff like that.  But if something is unclear, l
ike someone told me today one of the questions is a little bit vague for quiz one.  So I'll look at that it.  May be the case there are two correct answers.  That shouldn't be the case, but I'll look at it.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Ah, that was from the lecture last week.  So don't tell anybody, but if you look at the slides last week \_\_ [pause] \_\_ so, um, we are not reading this, but you can use, I think this is in the PDF\~
version of these slides.  When you are doing the homework, this might be something useful to reference.  I do say that for the book assignments, the goal is to have them look a}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 s}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  much like what's in the book as possible.  People have found black and white copies of the book online.  That's, of course, illegal.  And the probl
em with that is, if I'm asking you to make it look like in the book, you will not know what color it is.  That's a caution. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  And the online version that the library has, which is not illegal, some of those colors are not quite right.  So just get with someone who has the book.  Make sense? 
\par The books are actually pretty good.  I recommend get they can this, they are useful beyond this class.  All professors say that, but I don't know why a sociology book would be good.  But if you are visualizing data \_\_ if
 you like sociology, the textbook might be useful.  I actually still have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 mine}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  and my calculus books too.
\par So this class is about the data and telling stories with the data.  When we are telling stories with the data, certain things help us think about the
 stories to tell.  And one of them is patterns.  Let's see.  I have several examples in my head and I want to use them at the right time.
\par We use visualization to explore the data and we are looking for patterns.  It might be that the patterns are rise over
 time, it might be that the patterns are distributions of the data, right?  If I line everybody up in this class, the shortest person is likely not to be much shorter than five foot four, maybe five two.  The tallest might be six two.  If we saw someone t
hat was seven foot tal}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 l}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 , we would look.  That's an anomaly.  So anomalies in data are interesting and can lead to a story.
\par If you were in a company and your company has, over the last ten years, had an income from two million to three million, except for on
e year when it was a hundred thousand, that's an anomaly.  And the manager of the company, the CEO would ask why that is the case.  We are looking for anomalies in data.  We are looking for a pattern, it might be an upward trend, but what's the deviation?
  So that helps identify a story in the data set that you are looking at.
\par And changes over time.  And then in aggregate.  Last week, we used a function that counted for us.  Do you remember what function that was?  Table.  Right?  Table is kind of a way to 
aggregate data.  It looks at the different categories and counts them up and gives us information.  You do a lot of aggregation when visualizing the data.  The raw numbers are not that interesting, but some aggregation of them is.
\par We are looking for relationships when we think about the story in the data.  This is all about the story.  In statistics, we talk about causation and correlation, but we can look at a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 scatter plot}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  and see that as temperature }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 rises, so does the dew point, w}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 hich is just a weather t
hing that I'm not going to explain.  That could be a story, how the two variables are related.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 Scatter plot}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 s are one way to look at that.
\par In a week or so, we will look at how you find relationships between categorical relationships and [indiscernible] when
 you look at relationships between these two variables and compare to these two variables.  You might be looks at undergrad grades over time and compare to the graduate student grades over time.  That might be an interesting story.
\par And then, of course, whe
n we are telling the story, we are thinking about encoding.  I talked about encoding last week.  Do you remember what that means?  You guys clearly have not had your coffee yet.  Encoding.  We have got data and we are trying to represent it in some visual
 way.  That's the process of encoding the data visually.  Right?  We have a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 scatter plot}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
.  We will show the things as little circles.  We have got categories we will show as bars.  That's the process of encoding the data.
\par And now we talk, and I think visual this calls about context.  If I give a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 scatter plot}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
 and it's just the points, that doesn't help you, you can't make sense of that.  If I give you a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 scatter plot}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
 and just give a title, suddenly you have information, you can do something.  If I give a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 scatter plot}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  and}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid9240695  I give you members an the axis, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
now you have an idea of the scale of the data.  So each bit of text that I give you gives you more information that can help could you make sense of the plot.
\par He has a title a lot of times and then he has got 
smaller text, like a sentence or two or a small paragraph under the title.  That the called context text.  I think that's what he calls it.  That is what I'll call it.  So the visualization, you have that information.
\par So you might see source, that's also context.  If there is GDP\~data for the nation, gross domestic process, and it's from a diner, that is not as good as from the nation.
\par Where do you get data?  ICPSR.  That's a database from {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname State}}Michigan{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}.  Where would you get data from?  Where does data come from
?  You can definitely get data from the internet.  How about you?  Where would you get data from?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yeah.  There are tools that allow you to download data.  In fact, one of the doings, the data science book, it talks about using }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
 to collect tweets.  Where else might we mind data?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yes.  Administrative process.  Someone pays you, there is finance information in the company.  How about you?  Where would I find data?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Surveys.  And actually lots of lots of surveys have been done.  ICPS }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 \~
was mentioned.  A lot of researchers put their survey data online for people to download. 
\par Where might I find data?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Government, like any particular government website?  It's called data.gov.  Yeah.  You can go to data.gov.  Trump is in office, so that might go away.
\par Where else might you find data?  At a university.  There is lots of data that you can get from universities.
\par Social media?  Hospitals?  Schools?  Websites?  You can scape data.  Now, visualize this, in the first chapter I said we will not work with beautiful [indiscernible] it allows you to read a website the way a human does.
\par University?  Website?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yeah.  Does anybody know what weather underground is?  That is a website that provides weather, but what's interesting about it, all of the sensors belong to regular people.  And you can buy your own weather sta
tion at your house and set up your computer and it makes predictions.  University has their own weather underground station on top of carrier dome.  You can get the weather here at the university by going to weather under}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid9240695 ground}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 .  Isn't that cool?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  You can collect data by yourself.  Do you have an example?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yeah.  So my father\_in\_law has his own blood pressure monitor.  We can track his blood pressure.  How did you? 
\par Cell phones?  Do you have anything to say about that?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Like old people like me don't use tinder.  I'm married.  I don't.  We might have different app habits.  Right?  I just made that up.  That's catchy.  We should make an app about app habits.
\par How many people have iPhone?  Do you know it collects your information data when you go to \_\_ you can download that data.  If you use the Wi\_Fi at Starbucks, it records that.  If you are in an airport, it records your location.  And you can do
wnload that data.  I don't remember how, but you can do it.
\par How many people have bought something on Amazon in the last six months?  You can download your entire Amazon history.  How many people have a Facebook account?  You can download some of your Facebook data.
\par How many people have a fit bit?  A couple people?  You can get that data, right? 
\par So this kind of data that I'm talking about fits into the category of quantified self.  I have had students do quantified self posters.  You can do a Google history research.  Or what you watch on YouTube.  You might not want to share all of that.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yes.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  They don't say when I was riding a unicycle.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yes.  The point is there is tons and tons and data out there, which \_\_
 and we talked about some of the ways that you can get that data.  Data is got by doing surveys.  Someone mentioned surveys.  By calling API, application programming interfaces.  If you wa
nt Twitter data, you are actually hooking to a port at Twitter and say give me tweets related to X.  Facebook as an API.  Have you heard of Googling dart [phonetic]?  It's a website for people that are artists.  They have an AIP.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 I}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  site doesn't have an API
, you can scrape it.  That was mentioned.
\par When we use data, we always want to identify the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 sources;}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
 we will talk more about sources later.  But the sources help people identify or verify the quality and accuracy of the plots.  Today we will talk a little b
it about data formats.  And I always say when you are working with a data set, the first thing to do is explore it.  I'll give you a really clear example of that today in the lab.
\par Alright.  So what's the story with this plot?
\par STUDENT:  To observe [indiscernible] correlated and [indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  The story seems to be implying causality.  How many think this is a true store?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  What's wrong with this graph?  What makes this graph suspicious?
\par STUDENT:  The untrained eye, you would think you would walk away thinking [indiscernible] I don't want to increase [indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  First off, there is no such thing as organic cheerios.  What's wrong with the plot?  What makes \_\_ besides your knowledge that it's kind of lame to think that \_\_.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yes.  So let's think about that.  So this is individual's diagnosed.  And this is up to three hundred thousand.  This is a millions.  This is 25 thousand millions.  That's 25
 billion.  So if you look at organic sales, this line here, if we plot this on the same axis, there would be a flat line right down here.  Can you lie with graphics?  So here is our training example for this.  You know, think about what you are looking at
.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 Clearly,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  in the last election, people were not doing that. 
\par What are you interested in?  Olga, what's your poster about?  If I pick a data today, what's it?  Facebook data?  About what?  Network stuff? 
\par How about you?  What's your poster about if you pick today?
\par STUDENT:  I would choose my [indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Instagram?  That's quantified self.  How about you?  [Indiscernible] facts?  What kind of data?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Okay.  The school pays for a service called Lexis Nexus.  It allows you to look up topics in the media. 
\par Twitter data?  Sentiment analysis?  Facebook data is harder than Twitter data.  Trending for presidential elections.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yeah.  Okay.  Should I come back to you?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Urban planning data?  Good.  Soccer?  Every semester I get a couple of those.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  I'll get back to you.  I don't know if we have data on that.  How about you?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  University ranking?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Fitness trends.  Good.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Hmm.  Earthquake data.  USGS.  Yes?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Rating for prime time television shows.  What's that site?  There is a movie site that probably has that data.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  All of the places that you visited?  You are a globe trotter.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  What's it?  Pollution around the world?  Yes.  The {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname country-region}}U.S.{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} has great climate data and hopefully they keep it online.  How about you?

\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Health data.  Okay.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible] something to do with [indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Oh.  Okay.  How about you?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Social media data.
\par STUDENT:  I would be [indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Ah.  Yeah.  Okay.  And there is certainly research on that lately.  So there is probably data out there.
\par Crime data?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Okay.  Great.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  How many students are willing to buy textbooks in bookstores?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  What's a typical textbook these days?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Basketball?  Good.  People are thinking about this.  This is good. 
\par So what's data?  This should be easy, right?  What's data?  Observations.  Information encoded in a digital format.  Raw information.  Any other? 
\par Well, I'll say that data is always plural.  If you just have o
ne bit of data, it's datum.  And we don't necessarily need a concrete definition for data, because we will work with so many different kind of data, it clear from what I just asked people what they are working on.
\par I will say that data is often thought of a
s the precursor to information.  We will make information in this class from data.  That's kind of how I think about making, when you make a visualization.  If you put visualizations together with text and someone can make decisions based on that, it's ac
tionable.  And that's where knowledge comes from.
\par If you do that enough, then you get wisdom.  So we are in this part of the chain, right here, going from data to information.  So that's what I want to keep in mind.
\par Now, when we think about \_\_ when you get 
a data set and you explore it, the thing to think about, what can this data answer, what question can the data answer.  If you are a professional researcher, you come from a different perspective.  You say I have this question, what data do I need to answ
er it?  In this case, we have data and we will try to find the questions that it can answer.
\par Sometimes the visualizations can test out an idea or hypothesis.  In }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 statistics,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
 we talk about hypothesis testing.  I mentioned before, we are looking for the exceptional cases.  Sometimes your data has exceptional cases and it makes you mad, pause you didn't want them in there but they are there.
\par The point is to reduce uncertainty and maximize a favorable outcome.  If you work for a company, they clearly want this, 
right?  The posters will tell a story.  We will work in groups today.  We will actually work in groups several times in this class.  So the first one is a simple one to get people used to do that.
\par To keep it simple, you guys are a group.  This whole wing.  The first row, you are a group.  And then you are a group.  And then you guys are a group.  I'll take the two in the back and pair you up here.  Okay? 
\par That means you have to go there, like psychic will not work, you have to get close.
\par Here is what we will do.  Since we are thinking about data, I want you to tell me, each group will tell me what each one of these things is and give an example of that and to make this a little more fun for me, you are going to an organization.  
\par You guys are an airline.  Okay?  You guys in the back there, you are a weather company or a weather station.  You guys are some nonprofit organization.  You have to figure out what kind of organization and then you have to come up with examples.
\par You guys are a food company.  Okay?  Like General Mills or something like that.  And you guys are a university.  Okay? 
\par I'm going to forget all these, but your job is to not forget.  You are a university.  What were you?  Food company.  Nonprofit.  And then you are what?  Weather?  You are what?  Airline.
\par Okay.  You have got 15 minutes, but it will not take that long.  The point is, um, you will say so a boolean is true or false, or one or a zero.  How is that represented in the data set?  And what's an example.
\par You didn't use this one, I'm using it.  In my class, I could categorize men and women.  Right?  And that would be a boolean.  That would be a binary comparison.
\par So you have to come up with an example in the context of your organization.  An your mark, get set \_\_ and you have to do for each one of these \_\_ and go.  It's like five after now, so \_\_.
\par You don't have to find an actual data set.  Make up an example in your context. 
\par (Students are working on assignment.).
\par INSTRUCTOR:  I think next week we are going to be on Adobe Illustrator.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Thank you. 
\par (Students are working on assignment.).
\par INSTRUCTOR:  It doesn't have to continual grow.  It can be positive or negative numbers.  It's basically any number, concluding things with decimal points.  Like GPA?  Yes, that's right.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Be prepared to define them.  If you have an example, you have to make sense, but you don't have to give a formula.  You do, but they don't.  I'm kidding. 
\par Is the airplane done?  Are you guys done?  Are you guys done?  Are you guys done?  Are you guys close?  Are you guys close?  Okay.
\par Okay.  Here we go.  What's the name of the airline?
\par STUDENT:  {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}Orange{\*\xmlclose} Skies and only fly the sun set.
\par INSTRUCTOR:  That's good.  I may do that to the rest of you, so be ready.  (Laughter).  So what is \_\_ you don't have to define boolean, because we did, but what's an example in this case and how is it stored?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Good.  And then you guys are what?  Grocery store?  Great.  What's your boolean example?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Organic or not.  How are you storing it?  How do you store it?  One or zero.  Okay.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Ah.  So you are {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname City}}Syracuse{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}.  Can I have a raise?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  (Laughter).  We can talk about this.  This is negotiable.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Good.  And you can actually store as day and night.  How about you guys?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Graduate or undergraduate?  Good.  So we have two universities here.  Are you a public university?  No, the nonprofit said they are {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname PlaceName}}Syracuse{\*\xmlclose} 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname PlaceType}}University{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, which is cheating, but I'll let them get away with it. 
\par Do you have a question?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yes.  I'll come back to that.  Okay?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Well, so \_\_ you want me to get technical?  Here is, you can actually store as a factor, in which case you would see male, female, graduate, undergraduate, but it would technically be stored as a
 zero or one.  Okay?  That's to answer the question.
\par Categorical.  Airline?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Perfect.  Which one were you guys?  Weather?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Sure.  Absolutely.  And then you guys?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yep.
\par STUDENT:  Different isle in the grocery store, meat and products.
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Meat.  Dairy.  Candy.  The important stuff.  Beer.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yeah.  Yep.  How might we store this?  Anybody?  It could be a factor.  We can still use strings for this, but it could be a factor, right. 
\par Airline, ordinal rank?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yes.  And you would store those as integers, that would be great.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yeah.  You can set up a ranking system like that.  {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname City}}Syracuse{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}?  GPA?  Yeah.  You can do that.  You guys?
\par STUDENT:  Type of customer, regular, premium, Costco has [indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Okay.  Yeah.  You can do that.  That would require that you are storing as a numeric.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Oh, good.  Right.  You would have 1, 2, 3, 4.  So the point with ordinal is there, there is always a ranking system.  You could have negative numbers.  Right?  Like under regular, you can have [indiscernible], I don't know. 
\par Airline for count?
\par STUDENT:  The number of passengers.
\par INSTRUCTOR:  The number of passengers.  Perfect.  Can you have half a passenger?  Never.  I hope.  So, weather people?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Well, that would be a real number.  How about a count?  Has to be an integer, whole number.  Temperature could be a decimal.  How about number of cloudy days?  Right?  You can do that. 
\par University {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname City}}Syracuse{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  So you are talking about counting those students?  The number of?  And you guys?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Number of customers.  Is your store successful?  Okay.  That number is big and growing. 
\par And nonprofit?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yeah.  The [indiscernible] for passing in this case is 36.  Am I there?  I can count the student.
\par Airline, what's the numeric thing?  Those are continuous variables.  Weather station?  Temperature.  Absolutely.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  You can do that.  That would work.  Do assistant professors pay.  How about you guys?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  I'm not obsessed with that.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Sure.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  GPA.  Perfect.  String and character data airline?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Passenger information.  It could be name.  I like the name.  I like watching the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 sunrise}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 . 
\par Weather?  The weather data, there is something called a trained spotter.  A trained spotter is trained to notice that it's raining.  And they usually write a one line sentence about the weather conditions.  I know, it's funny, but it true. 
\par How about you guys?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Student name is perfect.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Employee name?  Yep.  Could be customer name.  Could be the product name.  There are a lot of examples to work.
\par Student name or professor name? 
\par You guys have it.  What is next? 
\par In }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 , those are all data types, they are actually not all da
ta types, but this one is a data type.  And numeric and continuous is a data type.  And }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 \~
string data is just called character.  There are complex data types in R.  And one of them is a vector.  A vector is a collection of all of the same type.  
So you can have a collection of trues and falses.  You can have a collection of strings.  The vector, everything in the vector is all the same type.
\par A list is different.  It holds multiple types.  In one list, you can have a string data, numeric data and boolean data all in the same list.  Okay? 
\par And then we have a data frame.  We will work with data frames a lot.  We will work with vectors and data frames a lot.  Lists, not so much.  And a data frame is basically like a spreadsheet.  So in your mind, imagi
ne an excel spreadsheet and it has a column of dates or a column that is names of students, it could have a column of air speeds.  I don't know that it would be in the same data set, but you might.
\par It also has specialized data types.  We will see one today
 called density.  But date and time is a specific kind of data type.  And you can do nifty things with it.  Working with dates is a pain.  So with will devote time to that a little later so you will be able to do that. 
\par There is something called AU document.  That's a collection of text.  And audio\_visual photo, those are things that you can work on in R.  We will do a little bit about photos.
\par Relational or network data.  This is like a social network graph.  And we will actually do this later in the semester too. 
\par And there is coordinate data.  Which would be Y\~and X, YXZ.  Or maps, longitude data.  What's this one?  This is polar coordinates.  So you have a circular plot and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  P is how far a line goes and [indiscernible] this is used in scientific data, but not so much in other applications.
\par Alright.  So we will take a break.  Ten minute}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 s}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
.  It is always according to my watch, sorry.  It is 10:25.  So be back at 10:35.  We will start our }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  log. 
\par (Class is taking a break).
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Anybody who is not back yet, let me know.  Alright.  It's about time.
\par So the first thing to do, if you have not done already, go to Blackboard, under data and images, and save all of these files to your desktop.  Or if you have a directory that you are working in, save them to that directory. 
\par The way that I save them, I just right click on them and there is a drop down, and I can save as.  So you want to make sure you have all of these files.  We will be working with, I think, all of them.
\par So, the way I always start out a lab, I go to file new, I go new file }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  script.  I'm changing \_\_
 you don't have to do this, but I'll change so people in the back with mostly read this.
\par [Pause].
\par Let's see.  They give me all of these cool controls here.  Is that better?  [Pause].  That's too dark.  I have to be able to read my paper. 
\par We will try that.  [Pause].  Now that I have got my header information from my file, I'm going to save this as net ID hyphen lab two dot capital R.  [Pause]. 
\par Okay.  I'm going to run this line and on my machine, when I run this line, an icon blinks down here.  And if I click on that icon, it brings to the front a choose dialogue.  Okay?  There is actually lots of ways to open files in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 , but in this class, I'll use this way.
\par In the choose dialogue box, navigate to files and I'm looking for one called tips.  If I select that and open it, I know it worked, because in my global memory environment there is a new object called tips dot file dot name. 
\par What's in tips dot file dot name?  If I just highlight that and run it, then down in the console window, it says a bunch of slashes, HD dot AD\_\_
 there are numbers.  The numbers are what we care about.  Yours is different than mine, I believe, because you have a different log in information.  And then documents desktop tips dot VSP.
\par This is the fully qualified path to the data file.  When you are writing scripts, there are different ways to open files, but a fully qualified path gets you to exactly where you saved the data.  In script development, this is handy.
\par I'll copy from my console almost the whole line.  I'll create a new variable called my dot desktop.  Put in this line.  We will use this [audio breaking up] make sure that it's right.  I have the four back slashes and a whole string 
up to desktop.  Then I have the last two slashes.  If you leave these last two slashes off, it will not work. 
\par This is a string, because the RStudio makes it green.  That's the code for it's a string or a comment.  I have to run that line in order for it to be in memory.  Once I run that line, I can see that my desktop is now up here.  Okay? 
\par Very clear?  Straightforward.
\par So here is one of our functions for today.  What's list files do?  Reduce what is in the directory that I have provided a path for.  And 
so I can look on here and I can verify that the files I have [audio breaking up] line dot text use that.  I have one called shootings under score one, underscore dot }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  DA.  We will use that.  And I have got tips dot CSV.  I don't know if we will use other ones.  Those are the files on my desktop.
\par So let's open our first file.  Open tips dot CSV.  Because tips file name contains the whole name of the file, I'll use that.  I'll header equal to true.  And I'll set strings at factors equal to false.
\par Yes?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Something happened with that string right there.  So the way \_\_ remember the way I got that string was I ran file choose and inside tips file dot name, I copied the whole string, except for the part that says tip
s dot CSV.  So the string here, my desktop, should look exactly like what's in here, except for the last part, the last file name. 
\par You want to run this.  And this brings up a file, choose dialogue.  Navigate \_\_ this is on the desktop?  So find the folder.  Pick tips.  This means that you have something in memory.  If you double\_
click this, and then click run, it will take whatever is in there and put it right down here on the console.  You want this whole part right here.  We will put that right inside there.  Paste it in there.  And then run that line. 
\par See, now you have the location of your desktop in that variable.  Then you want to run list files. 
\par So your desktop is \_\_ we want to get rid of that part.  When you run this, that's that.  If we list, those are all good things that are in there. 
\par Now, are the files in this directory or in a directory in this directory?
\par STUDENT:  They are in this directory.
\par INSTRUCTOR:  So you should be good.  You want this to be that.  So you want to copy the rest of that code. 
\par Alright.  So now if you have run this line here, then you should have something up here under data.  It says tips.  So what's in the data?  Anybody want to guess what this data is?  What?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  I'm sorry.  I still didn't hear you.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yes.  It's the sheet that we downloaded.  So take a guess, what kind of data is this?  Restaurant.  Why would you say that?  Tips.  Tips like tips?  So you got that just from the file's name.  That soun
ds trivial, but what we are doing, we will interrogate this data to figure out what it is.  The first step to doing that is the file name is a clue, just like a title on a plot.
\par So here is another thing, if I just double\_click tips and hit run, it puts all of this information up on the console.  If I scroll up to the top of this, what do you think?  What's this data?  Is it right?  Is it restaurant data?  How do you know that?

\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Dinner and lunch.  Something in here says time.  That's kind of a good clue.  Any other clues?  Total bill? 
\par So, in other words, you are looking at the data and you are looking at the column names.  And that kind of gives a clue about what the data is.  Right?  Okay.
\par I know that sounds trivial, b
ut the point is that you can look at your data, just look at it and it will give clues about what the data is.  You need to know what the data is in order to figure out how to plot it.  Right?  Or to figure out what kind of story might be in the data.

\par I'll
 show you functions that help you do this stuff.  So we did that, we just run the variable and it tells us what's in the variable.  Here is another one.  What's that one doing?  It's called dim.  Dimension.  What's that mean?  Rows and columns.  It's alwa
ys rows first and then columns.
\par I use this all of the time.  Comments.  That's this returning?  The names of the column and the data set.
\par I want to make sure I cover what I want you to know.  STR.  Structure.  Some people, for from people, this is the go to
 function.  I don't use this as much, but the great thing about this function is here is the column names right here.  So it's giving you what's in column names.  And then it's giving what's this?  This is the data type.  In }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 , it's called the mode.
\par Here are examples of the data.  This is the first observations in the data set.  And so just looking at structure, you get all of the information from all of the other calls right away.
\par Is anybody from Unix land?  Have you used head?  In Unix, you use head to look at the top of the file.  This is the same command at R.  This is a little bit of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  history.  You can say head five and it gives the top five rows.
\par There is another function, tail.  What's that?  The last couple of lines.  So these are things that give inside into the data.  Looking at data is super important..
\par Another one is called fix.  Fix brings up a new window that shows me the data set.  I think it only shows the first five thousand rows, but it might show the whole data set.  This is a spreadsheet view of the data.  And you can edit your data here. 

\par So, for example, if I double\_click on party size for row 13, I can change this to 20.  I am not going to, because that would change my data.
\par When this window is open, it allows you to edit the data, you can't do anything else.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
 locks all of the other inputs and commands while fix is open.  To get back to doing things in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 , you have to close that window..
\par Alright.  So those are functions that I'm going to hold you 
accountable for.  I want you to know these functions and roughly know what they are for.  If I ask you to tell me what a function is that allows you to interrogate the data set, these are functions that you can list. 
\par Now, we will work with this data set tips.  And I don't remember what the column names are, so I'll run that.  Actually, before that, I want to think about accessing data.  I'd like to see the whole first row.  So square brackets in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  allow you to subset the data or look at a piece of the data.  And like the dim function, rows are always first and then columns.
\par What I have here is tips.  Square bracket, one column and blank and then the square bracket.  This says show the first row and then all of columns.  I can look at a first column in a similar way.  That shows me the first column.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Right.  That's the first row and then the next is the first column.  The first column is boring.  So I'm going to look at the second column.  That looks like amoun
ts.  I don't know what the column is called, I look at call name and it says total bill. 
\par Those two things give me exactly the same thing.  So, in other words, I can reference a column using the column number, but I can use the column name as a string.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  case sensitive.  If you went capital T for total bill, it doesn't work.  It needs to know the exact thing.
\par But this also references it.  This is the way that I usually reference columns.  The dollar sign specifically says reference attribute of t
he data.  The data is tips.  And this says give me that column.  Okay.  Those are different ways that we can access data in the data set.  What's that doing?  This is the exact data point in the third row in the second column.  Those two values are exactl
y the same. 
\par If you are already a proficient programmer, this is review, but for folks who are not immerses in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
, this is will be new.  We will speed up pretty soon.  So this gives me the exact cell.  Right?  And I'm saying give me the third row in the second column.  This one is actually just saying start with the whole column and then give me the third item. 

\par Notice that when I'm doing this on a whole column, I don't have two values, just one.  That's because }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  is treating this like a vector.  }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 All the values are the same, it}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 s a vector.  Give me the third item in the vector.  Everybody got this?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Good question.  Dollar doesn't work with rows, only columns. 
\par So summary is another data interrogation function that I end up using a lot, because I want to understand what my data looks like.  This is one way to view the data, to understand what the minimum is and where the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid9240695 fourth}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  quartile is and what the medium, mean and third quartile is and the max. This is the same information, right?  So summary gives exact numbers.  
\par And hist shows the distribution of the tips total.  This is another function that you should know. 
\par Length tells me how much observations there are in a vector.  It's like dim, except dim is two dimensions and length is a specific vector. 
\par So, we care about sometimes as part of the story of the data is the distribution.  We used HIST.  That shows us one view of the data.  Instead of total bill, let's use tip.  Tip dollars tip.  So that's tip size.  This is also a distribution plot. 
\par It's kind of harder to see where the grouping is with this plot.  It is kind of clear that it's a skewed data set, that the density of the data seems to be in this area.  Right?  So this is one \_\_ these are two 
distribution plots and that's another one.  This plot emphasized there is a strong upward skew. 
\par Now, I'm going to make up a story.  It may not be right.  This is a restaurant.  Most tips are in this area.  That has a reflection of how much people pay for 
meals.  And this up here is possibly a guy who is trying to catch the eye of his waitress.  I don't know if that's true, but that's a story that I can tell from the data.
\par I can tell a story that sometimes the restaurant hosts large parties and so some meal
s get really big tips.  We don't know if either of those are true, but we can look into the data and find that out.  We are making a guess and telling a story from the distribution. 
\par Yep?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Right.  So I'm going to 
reframe what you asked.  When I just plot and pass in a vector of numbers, it actually plots in order.  So this is the first observation in the data set.  And one of these, probably that one, that's the last observation in the data set.  So it just plots 
the values in order.  The X axis doesn't mean anything except the order of the observations in the data set.
\par This is actually sorting the observations based on the size of the value.  So somebody is really a cheap scape, right?  And a couple of people have 
tipped quite a lot comparatively.  So one just gives us a value, which is useful sometimes, and one gives us the [indiscernible] sorted values. 
\par What's a box plot?  How many people have never seen this kind of plot before?  At least a handful of people.  What is it?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Right.  Sometimes, in this case the black is representing the immediate.  You can tell to give it [indiscernible] and mean.  That's the lowest data point.  This is the first quartile.  Those are the median
.  Those are, the third quartile.  And those are a further quartile range.  These are outliers.
\par This is another view in the distribution of tips.  So just in these four things, we have four different ways to look at distribution.  This comes up in the homework assignment. 
\par Okay, there is no credit called cream.  I changed to orange.  This is a distribution plot.  This is called density.  It like a histogram, but more nuisanced.  We can see this is bi\_modally.  That means two humps in a distribution.  This, 
I don't know that most of that is [indiscernible] it's kind of bi\_modal.
\par So this might reflect different dishes.  One dish is more expensive and people order that almost as frequently as the cheaper one so they tip appropriately.  I'm making things up.  These are stories from the data.
\par We can dig in and find more stories in the data. 
\par Okay.  Yes?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Ah.  So plot is a smart enough function to plot whatever B\~is.  We will look at these.  Polygon actually draws on top of the existing plot.  It doesn't create a new plot.  It draws \_\_ it is a function that writes on top of it. 
\par Didn't like that. 
\par There is a \_\_ we will talk more about that later, but the interesting thing there that you point out is you can actually make a plot and then you can make or call more functions to put more on the plot.
\par These are all distribution furnishings.  I have showed you five of them.  This is one of the plots we will turn in here.  These were part of last time.  What's part do?  What?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yes.  It sets the parameters of the plot space.  Now, I passed in something called MF\~row.  I don't know what that stands for, but MF\~row equals C32.  This tells the plot space to divide the plot space into three rows and two
 columns.  So now that I have called five plots, its actually sent one plot here, one plot here and so on and so forth.
\par Yes?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Okay.  So this is a good time to walk around and help people.  Good time to catch up.  
\par Make that a capital A. 
\par [Pause].
\par How come that's not right?  So somehow that was spelled wrong.  Here is a trick.  When I type something, it gives me this drop down.  If I hit tab, it will select whatever I'm selecting.  I'm a terrible speller}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid9240695 .}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  I use this fre
quently.  It gives me some of the main parameters.  If I just type file, it starts to fill it in.  And I can put in my variable name.  And that can help with those things. 
\par I'll coming back in a minute.  Let's me scroll up a little bit so you can see more of the screen.  Now, I made my polygon orange, if you are caught up to this point, I'd like you to change some of the values for the plots.  Like we did last week, right? 

\par So change the color of the histogram and change the PCH\~of the points.  Remember, you can double\_click on a function name and hit \_\_ oops, not run, hit F1.  It brings up help for that.  So you can see which other parameters to set. 
\par The point here is I want you to get familiar with the parameters for the different plots functions.  So your \_\_
 the version of this that you turn in is going to be more colorful.  You might have symbols for the points.  Look for the help of the functions and make them prettier. 
\par Keep going, I'll be back. 
\par How are you doing?  Do you need help?  Are you good?  Are you good?  Looks like you have got it. 
\par There are two ways.  One, you can call par MF\~row again \_\_ that sets up to one row and one column.  If you it the broom, it erases the plots in memory.  Okay? 
\par Are you good?  How are you guys doing?  Perfect. 
\par How are you doing?  Look at that, it perfect.
\par STUDENT:  I have a question, some integer columns are three rows.
\par INSTRUCTOR:  So it's actually \_\_ you can call this the plot space.  You can also call this window.  But plot space is technically more accurate.  This is great.  Put in comments in the code.  Very good. 
\par How are you doing?  You are fine. 
\par How are you guys doing?  Looks like you are playing with colors, which I highly appreciate.  Looks like you have got it.  How are you guys doing?  Looks like you have got it.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yeah.  You can do kind of do the same thing.  We know that \_\_ it's not always the same.  Let me drive for a second.  Many are the same.  If I highlight hist \_\_ you didn't give it a title, but name give it
 a title.  You can change the limits of it.  You can change the labels.  So X\~lab, Y\~lab, allow you to do histogram labels.  Right now that's the X\~and the Y\~label.  But you can change those.
\par For plot, oops \_\_ for plot, F1, right now the type is P.  That's the default.  But you can change to L.  You can change to H.  You can give it a title.  You can change the labels, X\~and Y\~
labels.  You can also do one called PCH.  So let's do this for fun.  Column equals \_\_ I'll set this to red, but you can change to other columns.  PCH. 
\par STUDENT: What's PCH?
\par INSTRUCTOR:  I'll show you.  So remember those are a parameter that you can pass the plot called PCH?  It changes the symbol type from the points to other things.  We don't have memorized in our head the different s
ymbol types, so go into Google and type all PCH\~symbol types and it returns examples of different symbol types that you can use. 
\par How are you doing?  Good.  Did you get the big plot too?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  So LTY\~stands for line type. 
 For polygon, if you set line type, the default is one, and if you set it to two, it will change the border around the thing to a dashed line.  So let's just run that.  It's hard to see, but there you go.  That's the dash.  And three is dotted line.  It n
ot super obvious on that plot, but on other plots, it would come out more obvious.  Like you can change this to a line and you can change the line type to three and it would make a dotted line. 
\par So you will just set the color, like he has color and he has got X\~lab and Y\~lab.  He is changing, what's X\~
lab do?  If you change one or two things, you are okay.  For histogram, put a comma, just right inside.  And then a space.  And then type COL.  That the going to be color equals and then in quotes, type red, fo
r example.  If you run that, the bars will be red.
\par If you want to start the plot over, you can select from here and that will reset the plot space.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Because it's actually broken up the plot space into all of those different pieces.  It's going to break it up into three rows and two columns. 
\par So there is the first one.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Wait.  Wait.  There is the next one.  If you want to just work with one plot, you can come up and hit the broom and it clears the plot space.
\par STUDENT:  You can do one by one?
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yep, but turn in the whole piece.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Right.  Do one by one first.  And then run that with all of them together.  Go ahead and just do one per plot. 
\par Did you have a hand up?
\par STUDENT:  I'm just trying to go over lab [indiscernible] and basically [indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Don't do that yet.  That's the next thing we will do, like right now.  You are ahead of the game already. 
\par Look at that.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  This is perfect.
\par STUDENT:  Do I need to change?
\par INSTRUCTOR:  You can if you want.  What's your question?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  I forget.  I don't know, but double\_click on the word plot and hit F1.  That's usually how I get there.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Oh.  So either there is an error someplace or there is an error and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 \~
didn't clear itself afterwards.  If I hit return, it still says there is an error. 
\par So here, you have an open parentheses and another open parentheses.  This closed parentheses matches that one, but you don't have one that matched that one.  You just need a closing parentheses for each one. 
\par That's a nice purple you have got there. 
\par Alright.  I'm going to put you on pause for a moment with playing with the parameters.  We will save this plot and remember how we saved it last week?  We went to export \_\_ first we changed the device or the plot space to be shaped how we want it. 

\par In this case, I want it to be ta
ll and kind of narrow.  So move the plot space window around.  In my case, I want it to be skinny like this.  So make it like this.  Go to export and go save as PDF.  This is something that I really want could make sure that you have got in your head very
 clearly.  You can control the aspect of the plot space.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 What's aspect mean?  Ratio of width to height.  By just siding this window.  And once you have an aspect that you like, you can go into the save plot at PDF\~
and there is a drop down list for PDF\~size. 
\par I'm going to knock points off if your plot space is like {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname country-region}}U.S.{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 letter.  Not because I don't like you, but because I want to make sure you understand how to set the aspect.  Set to device size.  We drag that down to where it says device size. 
\par Then the numbers up here reflect how you have got this set.  Mine says six point five two by nine point eight.  It's six inches wide and nine inched tall.  I'm not concerned with now you set you, mainly I want to know that you can set it.  Make sense? 

\par So you can be 
creative.  You can make it very long and narrow, if you want.  You can do that in five plots.  That's not terribly beautiful, but that's not so bad.  And then I could export this as a PDF.  Set this to device size.  Except I'll override the devise size.

\par I have got five plots.  I'll set ten inches tall and two inches wide.  If it's not letting me set it, it's saying that's the minimum size.  I'll set to 12.  So mine is four inches by twelve inches.
\par And then I'll save you plot after saving.  It's important th
at I set the directory, where it's saving, otherwise it will get lost.  I want mine on my desktop, but you might have a directory where you are putting it.  I select the folder, then give a plot name.  Call this multiplot. 
\par Because I had view after saving, it puts a PDF\~up.  Look, it has put all five plots, one on top of the other, because I have MF\~
row sets to five rows and one column.  The example was three by two.  So you can actually do one by five and make it long and skinny, if you want.  The main thing I want is to know you can do this.  So be creative.
\par Once you save this plot, this is one of the plots that you turn in. 
\par Now I had a student a minute ago ask, hey, I think men are Cheapskates and I want to see if men tip differently than women.  Okay, s
he didn't say it exactly like that.  But the point it, it's nice to be able to compare distributions of subsets of the data.  So I'll show you two different ways to subset tips by male and female.
\par Okay.  [Pause].  Now, I don't remember exactly what the values look like, so I could run tips dollars sex and make sure that my spelling and case are correct.  In this case, it's got a capital M\~
for male.  If I used lower case, it would not find anything.
\par There is a function, though, called unique.  This is a hand
y function to know.  I don't think I quiz you on this, but it's one of the functions that I use frequently.  It's showing me the possible values that exist in a column or in a vector that I pass in. I'm a terrible speller, and I often use that. 
\par So this is a quick way to subset a data set.  Remember tips is a data frame.  It's like a spreadsheet.  So when I'm referencing it, I always give it rows and columns.  There is always going to be a comma here.  I'm putting a space after the comma}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 ,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  saying give all columns.  What's before it, it's a comparison.  In our two equal signs, it's the operator for comparison.
\par I'm saying whatever tips dollar sex equals male, wherever that comparison is true, give me that row.  My assignment operator is the less than sign and the minus sign.  So now what's }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 its}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  doing, it's taking just the rows where sex is male and putting them into a new data frame.  I can highlight male dot tips and run and see that all of the values in there are just from males.

\par Yes?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yes.  A parentheses is always used for functions.  Square brackets are used for subset or reference. 
\par Okay.  So that's one way to do it.  There is actually like fifty ways, but I'll show the two that I use most often.
\par [Pause].
\par I make a lot of mistakes when I code.  I have only been coding since 1981.  I still make mistakes.  If you are making mistakes, if you are not making mistakes, I'm jealous. 
\par But because I make a lot of mistakes, it means that I figure out a lot of way of where my problem is.  And in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
, the easiest thing to do is highlight a piece of the code and run just that, then you can see what's in there.
\par So as an example, I'll highlight that piece right there.  Just what's inside of the square brackets, not including the comma, and run that.  Look what comes back.  This is a vector of trues and falses.  That gives some insight into how }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 
\ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 \~is subseting the data.  It's saying yes give me this row, don't give me that row.  Yes that row, not this row, not this row.  
That's what the trues and falses are doing.
\par And that is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 how it's creating the subset, w}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 hich [phonetic] does something different.  I use witch all of the time}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid9240695  \_\_ they are just everywhere, w}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 hich does the comparison and puts what comes back in here.  What comes back is not true false.  It is the row numbers, row that was true. 

\par Yes?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Call names.  I use them a lot.  There are a couple others.  Which is powerful, it allows you to do all sorts of different kind of comparisons and to store the index, which comes in handy later. 
\par Then I pass the index in the square brackets with a comma after the index}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 ,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
 saying give me all of the columns.  Now I have got a data set for female tips. 
\par I can verify that, right?  I can verify it's correct by double\_clicking and running.  Look, it's just the female values.  The male tips just has the male values.  
\par We want the distributions of tips.  This is the other plot that we will turn in.  I'll clear my plot space, because I don't need this plo
t anymore.  Click on the broom.  That says are you sure that you want to clear the cool plots that you made?  I say, well, yeah, I do.
\par When I'm comparing the distributions, I want to use the same type of distribution plot.  I'll choose a box plot here.  [Pause].  I did this as rows, but I think this would be easier to compare side\_by\_
side.  But the problem with this is, they have different scales.  So I'll give them the same scale. 
\par This is a little old school, I admit, why are you laughing?  Is that sexist
 or old school?  Is that okay.  Did I offend anybody?  So I put these on the same scale so I can see and clearly compare the two box plots.  I could have used a histogram.  I would have wanted to set the scale there.  With a histogram, it's linear, so I w
ould have put one on top of the other for easier comparison.  This is a vertical plot, so I put them side\_by\_side. 
\par To make this cooler, I'll put in another parameter here.  It didn't like that.  Oh, well, skip that.  What's the question?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  That was a great question.  In fact, the question is some plots are more useful than others at looking at a set of data and how do you know?  There is not exactly a right answer.  There are better answers for some kinds of data.  For 
example, a box plot doesn't work for categorical data, it works for continuous data. 
\par A line chart doesn't work for categorical data, it's better for trend data, something over time where the data points are connected together.  We are actually talking mor
e about that as the semester progresses.  But sometimes it's up to your judgment.  So if I ask you to show me a distribution, any of the five plots that I have showed you are appropriate.
\par Sometimes for a distribution, you actually want to use two different plots, because they give you slightly different information. 
\par So I know I didn't exactly answer your question, but it's kind of open ended.  Some of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 its}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
 aesthetics.  Right?  Okay, I used ten different line charts in my poster, I think I'll mix it up and use something different just to change the aesthetics.  That would be appropriate.
\par Yes?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  The tips are not \_\_ well, we don't know that.  Right?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Right.  That's right.  We are making assumptions here that may be incorrect.  We are assuming people tip fifteen percent, what's the start thing in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname place}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns2{\factoidname country-region}}America
{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}.  Unless you are AU graduate student, then it's five percent.  You don't have the money.
\par The point is, you are right, we don't have enough real information.  We could find the percentage of tips of tip total column and go further.  We will do more of that in future classes, okay?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  It does sort of seem to suggest women are more frugal.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  You know, right.  So we don't really know, right?  This could be \_\_ so this could be a data set that is fifteen years old or twenty years old or thirty years old.  It comes from a time when men took women out of dinner.  So they w
ere paying more because they were doing more.  And this could be just going out to lunch.  We don't know, we would have to dig into the data deeper.
\par You are talking about \_\_ it points to the fact that we are looking at one dimension of the data.  To 
answer the questions you are asking, we have to aggregate two dimensions of the data.  We will do that soon.  It's not hard.  When you make posters, those are the kinds of complicated questions that you will be asking.
\par Distribution is one picture, right?  It's just one piece.
\par Are there other questions about these?  
\par We want to save this plot.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 However,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  you made it, um, so go to \_\_
 I'm in a tall skinny mood today, maybe because I'm short and round.  Save this as a PDF\~on to the desktop.  Box plots.  We will do a couple of things before we call it a day.
\par There are my two plots. 
\par We have been working with tips.  Tips was a CSV data file, right?  What's that stand for?  Common separated values.  And a lot of data that you work with is going to be CSV format.  We 
can hook up to databases and do sophisticates stuff, but not in this class. 
\par We will, however, possibly work with TSCs.  Tab separated files.  Sorry.  I have to skip to the top for a second.  My desktop.  I'm copying that.  [Pause].  Paste is one of my top
 ten functions.  It's not my top five.  Paste is a cool function.  It puts things together for you. 
\par By default, paste will }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  calls.  It will separate them by a space.  I'm telling it to separate these by an empty string.  So it's just two quotes
 right next to each other.  I'm taking the value that was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 on }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 my desktop and I'm concatenating or splicing \_\_
 I believe the filing have a capital W.  You might want to check that.  It does? 
\par I'm putting that into a variable called wine file.  Before we used a function called CSV, now we use a function called [indiscernible] table.  New dot table.  Read table takes most of the same kinds of parameters.  [Pause]. 
\par There are a couple of things to point out about this.  First off, we set this to false last time too.  Right?  So tell me again what does this parameter do?  Someone said it before.  This is the kind of thing that could be on a quiz.  Hint.  Hint. 
\par So strings is factors.  When you read a file in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  and it sees strings, it automatically turns 
them to categorical data.  It makes it harder to work with.  Like if you have names, if you are AU university and you have students names and you read that data in, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  treats as a category instead of a string value.  Most of the time we want to work with values as strings.  So in this class, we are almost always going to set strings as factors equal to false.  This prevents }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 \~from reading in character data as categorical or factor data.  Okay? 
\par Is that clear?  That's the first piece.
\par The second piece is remember in paste, we said use separator as an empty string.  When we are using read table, there is no default separator for the file, but we want separate based on tabs.  This is the signal to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  that you will separate on tabs.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 It's}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
 a forward slash and a T.  If I just put a tab in, it looks like a white space.  If I have a forward splash and N, it's line breaks and each line has a separate value.
\par Now we have wine in here.  What's this data set?  What?  It's wine.  Different types.
\par Take three minutes and figure it out, like we did with the tips.  Who has got it?  This is like a wine store, this is Bevmo [phonetic].  I made this data up for us to play with.  This is wine sales data.  What else could you tell me it?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  How much is sold.  What's a question that you can answer with this data?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  We can find out total dollar amount of wine total.  What else?  We can actually figure out when wines were sold.  What else?  Which kind of region and what's the other one?  Different varieties of wines.  Different types.
\par This is a rich data set.  There are a bunch of questions that we can answer in this data set.  And how did you find that out?  Just looked at the data and 
the column names.  Sometimes the column names are weird, like DX42 D.  Not helpful.  A lot of times the column names help you figure out what's in the data set.
\par Which region sells the most wine?  So that's \_\_ we are making assumptions there, right?  This m
ay not actually be true.  Each line in this data, when I look at the column names, one of the column names says units sold.  So each line represents a sale, not how much wine was sold.  So this plot actually is telling me what?  It's actually sales per re
gion, not how much wine was sold.
\par In central, they could sell many units per sales.  So we have to dig deeper, but this is kind of a distribution plot, it's a distribution of categories.  It counts how much sales there were.  If I would ask you which region
 sold the most, had the most sales \_\_ if I asked which region had the most sales, you can answer that was a bar plot.
\par If I asked you which region sold the most wine, we have to dig deeper.  We will do that soon. 
\par Let's save this plot also.  We are almost done, which is good, because we are almost out of time.  I'll list files again.  I don't remember the name of the file that I want to open.  Yes?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yes.  You can just call PA }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 , MF row equals C comma one.  That }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 lets}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  to one column, one row.
\par So in my, when you list the files on desktop, I'm looking for this one.  Shooting RDA}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
[phonetic].  I'm big on copy and pasting.  Now we did a CSV and a TSV, an }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  DA\~file is different.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 It's}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  a native }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  data 
file.  When I loaded this file, I typed load and gave a path to define, it loaded into memory whatever was in there.  In this case, there is shootings.  It has 233 objects. 
\par What's great about }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  native files, you can have multiple data frames, ve
ctors and lists, you can save your whole data environment right there into one file and then load that.  Which means you can be working in here in the lab, save everything in one file and take it home on a thumb drive and work on it there.
\par I'll show you next week, I think, how to do that.
\par But part of this solution is in this command right here, it's called LS.  This goes back to Unix and it lists the data objects that you have in memory.  
\par Let me make sure that I have covered the functions that we need to}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695  cover.  What the STR}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
?  Structure the data.  What's fix do?  Gives you the edit data window that looks like a spreadsheet.  What's dim?  Dimension of the data.  How about length?  Gives you the amount of things in a vector.  You remember call na
mes.  You remember table.  What's table do?  Table counts the things in something.  What's unique do?  Gives you the unique values in a column. 
\par So unique and table are similar.  Unique gives the names, table gives names, but also the count of those things.  So you use table more than unique.
\par Summary?  The mean, distribution, sorted information. 
\par Some of the distribution functions we used were box plot, histogram, plot.  There was one more.  Density. 
\par Alright.  So we have done some cool stuff.  We used par, we used it last week and this week.  There is one last thing that I want to show and then I'll let you go. 
\par We found density, remember that?  We plotted D\~for density and it gave this thing.  What's D?  Is it a vector?  It's actually something different. 
 I would like to know what kind of object it is.  So I'll call a function called class and pass in D.  Then art tells me it's a density object.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 \~is an }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695\charrsid9240695 object-oriented}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
 problem.  You don't see it the way as you do in python and other languages, if you don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry about it, it's not on a test, this is for people with other languages.
\par It's this weird object called a density object, it's not a vector or anything else.  I guess use a function called attributes and at
tributes tells me the thing that I can access inside of this object using the dollar sign.  There is an X, Y, BW, I don't know what that is.  An N.  I can access these.  I can plot it, that really gives me the same plot.  It's just that I'm specifically c
alling the X\~and Y.  And }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 's default way of plotting thing when you giving an X\~and Y, it's to apply, like a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 
\insrsid9240695  scatter plot}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  the Y\~and Y points.  It plots them at points.
\par If you are familiar with other object oriented programming languages, this is here }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 \~
is object oriented.  It has a function that knows how to handle different thing that you pass it.  The people that created the density object created a plot function that knows how to deal with D\~when you just pass density.  There are other
 incidences of that later in the semester.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  No.  It's not quite that cool.  So we will use specific functions like the map function, the map package and other things to, to stuff like that.  GG plot has mechanisms for
 dealing with [indiscernible].  If you don't know what that is, you will by the end of the semester.
\par Other questions?  Was this cool?  Are you guys going to be great plotters or what?  Alright.  We will done for today.  I'll walk around and answer questions for a few minute.
\par If you have uploaded the plot with all of the different distribution types, the male and the female tips plot, and the bar plot that we just made, that's enough. 
\par I should now you, in case you forgot, because I have a short memory too, I have got the multi}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
plot.  I have got this plot.  I have got this plot.  To combine the files for turning them in, if I right click on any one of the PDFs I created, I get an option called combine files in acrobat.  I showed this last week, but this is important.
\par When I hit combine files, it give this view.  It shows me the plot that I created.  Now I can just drag and drop in the other two and there is my plots.  That's not quite the one I created.  Let's see, there is the bar plot, there is this one, mayb
e I didn't save that one, but you did.  Now I have too many plots.  I highlight and hit delete or remove, it goes away.
\par I want to hit the button called combine files.  It creates one PDF\~that has all of the plots combined into one file.  There are different scales, but that doesn't matter.  I don't care about that.
\par Any other questions?
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Today you don't need to be prettier than what you already are.  You are all so gorgeous anyway.  
\par So you have a hamburger there?  Alright then.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Let me take a look.  So this is probably a capital.  Let's run that line.  I'll double click and make sure it looks right.  That looks right.  I'll run this.  You used argument.  So, so when it says unused 
argument, that's saying one of these arguments I don't recognize or something is wrong.  In }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 
, that has to be all caps.  Run that line again, let's see what it does.  Still unused argument.  Alright.  That might mean you are missing an S.  Right there.  Run it again.  Look at that. 
\par You are next.  Has it been doing this all day or just start doing it?  So you actually have two }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 \~
sessions open.  It's stuck?  So this one, you have the file saved.  This one is stuck.  Task manager.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Yeah.  You are stuck.  How come they don't let us do task manager?  That's so lame.  Let's try and close this one.  You have this file saved.  You might have to restart.  Look, It went, now this one might go too.  I think yo
u are really stuck, I can't even right click on it. 
\par Those three plots, yep. 
\par See that T\~right there?  That slash should be this way.  Yep.  Try that.  I think that was it.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Let's see what's going on.
\par STUDENT:  [Indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Some of these stuck.  You opened another one.  Make sure you save this file.  See how it's not saving?  It's gotten confused.  So take this and copy this and paste it into a text file.  You are actually going to have to kill R.
  Try this, go to the magnifying glass and type note pad.  We want note pad plus plus.  And then create a new document.  So cancel that.  Paste it in there.
\par Now we have to save this someplace to make sure we don't lose it.  Let's see if we can kill R.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695 \~
is not responding to us.  On some machines, the task manager doesn't come up. 
\par Was this all of the same?  Did you save this?  This is in the cleaning stage.  We have the task manager.  Kill.
\par Let's go back and open RStudio.  Let's load it.  See if this is the same.  We got to this point.  But it doesn't have a lot of memory.  We are done. 
\par If you are done, you can go. 
\par Do you have tips?  Try this.  Now you have to step through and reload stuff.  Are you good?  Did you have a question?
\par STUDENT:  You just want to know how to [indiscernible].
\par INSTRUCTOR:  Usually net ID.  This was lab two.  So say net ID lab two.  You want to turn in the PDF\~and the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid9240695 R}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid3409335\charrsid9240695  file.
